## Polyrhythms Project
### This project creates a visual diagram that corresponds with music notes being played, all while using fundamental math concepts to display the project.
#### The project displays a collection of concentric semicircles, with a ball following the path of each semicircle. As the ball makes contact with either end of the semicircle at the bottom of the screen, it will play a specific frequency. It will bounce continuously.
